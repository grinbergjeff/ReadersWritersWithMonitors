/*
Project 4 - Readers and Writers Using A Monitor
CS 311
Code by: Jeffrey Grinberg
*/

/*
Notes:
	Mode: B -- Writers have absolute priority
	
	Order of Coding Operation:
		-- Design Main
			-- Allocate space for threads
			-- Initialize Pthreads/Mutexes/Conditional Variables
			-- Create Pthreads
			-- Enforce that Writers are created first (added precaution).
			-- Join Pthreads
			-- Destroy Pthreads/Mutexes/Conditional Variables
		-- Implement Functions
			-- thread_reader
				- For every thread we read, we will run the respective monitor and read the DB.
			-- thread_writer
				- For every thread we write, we will run the respective monitor which tells us if we can write from the DB.
			-- read_monitor
				- The monitor will determine if we are allowed to read from the DB. It intakes if it should begin or end.
			-- write_monitor
				- The monitor will determine if we are allowed to write from the DB. It intakes if it should begin or end.
			-- writeToFile
				- Write the values of access timestamps to the output file.
				
	*** Consider implementing a debugger!
	
	*** INPUT AND OUTPUT FILES NEED TO BE HARDCODED IN [IN A DIRECTORY]!
	
	*** Instead of sleep, run a loop, but compile without optimization?
